\ Fundamental Ops for FCC's portable engine: Linux x86_64.
\ This targets GCC's flavour of assembly.

\ This is a portable Forth file that declares the macros needed by the portable
\ FCC engine. These are called while the engine generator is running. The emit
\ assembly instructions as strings into a buffer, and consume and return
\ generation-time values such as which scratch register to pop into.
